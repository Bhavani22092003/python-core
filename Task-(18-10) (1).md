### Ascii values


```python
ord('a')
```




    97




```python

```




    90




```python
chr(90)

    'Z'



## Classes: 
*  classes are blue print of an object


```python
print (dir('x'))
```

    ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__', '__delattr__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__getnewargs__', '__getstate__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init_subclass__', '__iter__', '__le__', '__len__', '__lt__', '__mod__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rmod__', '__rmul__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__subclasshook__', 'capitalize', 'casefold', 'center', 'count', 'encode', 'endswith', 'expandtabs', 'find', 'format', 'format_map', 'index', 'isalnum', 'isalpha', 'isascii', 'isdecimal', 'isdigit', 'isidentifier', 'islower', 'isnumeric', 'isprintable', 'isspace', 'istitle', 'isupper', 'join', 'ljust', 'lower', 'lstrip', 'maketrans', 'partition', 'removeprefix', 'removesuffix', 'replace', 'rfind', 'rindex', 'rjust', 'rpartition', 'rsplit', 'rstrip', 'split', 'splitlines', 'startswith', 'strip', 'swapcase', 'title', 'translate', 'upper', 'zfill']
    


```python
x="python"
```


```python
x.upper()
```




    'PYTHON'




```python
def foo(x):
    s=''
    for ele in x:
        if ord(ele) in range(65,91):
            s+=chr(ord(ele)+32)
        else:  
            s+=ele
    return s
```


```python
foo('Apple')
```




    'apple'



## String methods

* Strings are <b>Immutable</b>, the resulting strings from string methods have a <b>new memory location</b>
* <u>in order to use these strings,we need re-assign it to a var</u>


```python
z='''Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?'''
z
```




    'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\nA peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.\nIf Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,\nWhere’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?'



### Upper()
 it will converted into capital letters


```python
print(x,'\n')
x.upper()  ## Upper() ---> it converts into uppercase 
```

    python 
    
    




    'PYTHON'




```python
print(z,'\n')
z.upper()
```

    Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
    A peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.
    If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,
    Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked? 
    
    




    'PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS.\nA PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS PETER PIPER PICKED.\nIF PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS,\nWHERE’S THE PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS PETER PIPER PICKED?'




```python
zu=z.upper()
```


```python
id(z)

```




    2354358186704




```python
id(zu)            
```




    2354358189584




```python
a=[1,2,3]
```


```python
id(a)
```




    2354361694016




```python
a.append(4)
a
```




    [1, 2, 3, 4]




```python
id(a)
```




    2354361694016



### Lower ()


```python
zu
```




    'PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS.\nA PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS PETER PIPER PICKED.\nIF PETER PIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS,\nWHERE’S THE PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS PETER PIPER PICKED?'




```python
zl=zu.lower() # 
```


```python
zl
```




    'peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\na peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked.\nif peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,\nwhere’s the peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked?'




```python
zl.capitalize() # starting alphabet is converted into capital case
```




    'Peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\na peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked.\nif peter piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,\nwhere’s the peck of pickled peppers peter piper picked?'



### Title()



```python
zl.title() # first alphabet in every word converted into capital case
```




    'Peter Piper Picked A Peck Of Pickled Peppers.\nA Peck Of Pickled Peppers Peter Piper Picked.\nIf Peter Piper Picked A Peck Of Pickled Peppers,\nWhere’S The Peck Of Pickled Peppers Peter Piper Picked?'




```python
'123abc !def zx'.title()
```




    '123Abc !Def Zx'



### Swap case()


```python
z.swapcase() 
```




    'pETER pIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS.\na PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS pETER pIPER PICKED.\niF pETER pIPER PICKED A PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS,\nwHERE’S THE PECK OF PICKLED PEPPERS pETER pIPER PICKED?'



### Case fold()

* This means the casefold() method converts more characters into lower case compared to lower() . For example, the German letter ß is already lowercase so, the lower() method doesn’t make the conversion. But the casefold () method will convert ß to its equivalent character ss .


```python
x="the ß character called eszett"
x.casefold()

```




    'the ss character called eszett'



## Todays Task :


Document today’s class with proper explanation using markdown, comments, examples and code.
  
## 1. Explain why strings are Immutable by taking a string method as an example. 
 



```python
a=('BHAVANI')
b=a.lower() ##lower()---> it converts to small letters
b
```




    'bhavani'




```python
print(id(a)) ## id() --->Gives the memory location
```

    1867130105200
    


```python
print(id(b))
```

    1867130113776
    

* Here a and b are a same characters but in opposite case ,the memory location of <b>a and b both are different</b> 
* <b>So Strings are Immutable </b>
* Immutable : It cannot be changed, Once an immutable object is created, its value remains permanent and unchangeable.

## 2. Take a two strings of your choice, 

* Reverse one string
* Concatenate these two strings
* Get the alternate chars of the concatenate string in reverse order.



```python
p='Andhra'
q='pradesh'
```


```python
p[::-1] ## here we are using negative step-size for reversing the string ,[::] give the entire string
```




    'arhdnA'




```python
r=p+q  ##---> "+" it is used for concatenating--->it means adding strings by using "+" symbol
print(r)
```

    Andhrapradesh
    


```python
r[::-2] ##--> here we are using step size "-2" for jumping to alternate numbers
```
