### String_find ( )

* <b>String.find()</b> is a useful function for searching and locating substrings within strings, which is a common operation in programming and text processing.<b>It determine the position of a specific element or substring</b> within a larger piece of text, such as a string. 

* <b>Syntax</b> : S.find(sub[, start[, end]]) 

* Sub: Here sub means the letter you want to find in the string.
* Start : start means ,the number you want to start from.
* End : End means,the number you want to end.

* If the <b>element or substring is found</b>, find() typically<b> returns the starting position of the first occurrnce</b>
* And <b>if it's not found,it often returns a special value like(-1) to indicate that.</b>
* It Returns the lowest index.


```python
x= '''How much wood would a woodchuck chuck 
if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, 
and chuck as much wood
As a woodchuck would if a woodchuck could chuck wood'''
```


```python
x.find('a') ##---> it gives first occurence of 'a' from left to right
```




    20




```python
x.find('ze')
```




    -1




```python
x.find('a',21) ##--->it gives first occurrence of 'a' after 21
```




    42



### String_rfind ( )

* In simple language,<b> string_rfind() </b>is a function used with strings in programming to <b>find the last (rightmost) occurrence </b> of a specific substring within a given string. It works similarly to the regular find() function, but instead of finding the first occurrence, <b>it finds the last one.</b>

<b>syntax</b>:S.rfind(sub[, start[, end]]) 

* Sub: Here sub means the letter you want to find in the string.
* Start : start means ,the number you want to start from.
* End : End means,the number you want to end.

* <b>If the element or Substring is found</b>,find() typically returns the <b>ending position </b>of the<b> first occurrence</b>
* And <b>if it's not found</b>,it often <b>returns</b> a special value <b> like(-1) </b> to indicate that.
* It returns highest index


```python
y = 'Andhra Pradesh'
```


```python
y.rfind('a')##---> it gives first occurence of 'a' from right to left

```




    9




```python
y.rfind('could')
```




    -1




```python
y.rfind('a',0,7)
```




    5



### String_count ( )
<b>The count()</b> method in Python is a built-in string method that is used to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring or element in a given string, list, or any other iterable. The method <b>returns the count of occurrences as an integer.</b>
* You can also use the start and end parameters to specify a particular portion of the string in which you want to count occurrences. 


<b>syntax</b> :S.count(sub[, start[, end]])

 where,
* Sub: Here sub means the letter you want to find in the string.  
* Start : start means ,the number you want to start from.
* End : End means,the number you want to end. 


```python
x='Ice creams'
x.count('a')
```




    1




```python
x.count('a',4,11)

```




    1



### String_Index ( )

* Strings are typically treated as sequences of characters, and each character in the string is assigned a numeric index. The index is used to specify the position of a character within the string. The first character usually has an index of 0, the second character has an index of 1, and so on.
* It starts from left to right(From starting).

<b> Syntax</b> :z.index(value, start=0, stop=9223372036854775807, /)

where,
* value : It means the character you want to search for.
* Start : start means ,the number you want to search from.
* End : End means,the number you want to end.



* If the index() find , it will display the character which is stored in the number of index you give.
* If the index () not found ,it throughs an error.


```python
z=('germany germany')
z.index('m',0,14)
```




    3




```python
 ## z.index('z',0,11) remove comments to see an error
```

### String_rindex ( )

* The rindex() method is a string method in Python that is used to find the last occurrence of a specified substring within a string. It is similar to the index() method, which finds the first occurrence, but rindex() searches from the end of the string backward.
* It searches from right to left(from the last).

* <b>Syntax</b> : S.rindex(sub[, start[, end]])

where, 
 * Sub : It means the index value you want to find in the string.
 * start: It means starting index,where you want to search from.
 * End :It means where do you want to end.
 
 

* sub is found, such that sub is contained within S[start:end]. 
* Raises ValueError when the substring is not found.


```python
c=('united States')  
```


```python
c.rindex('t',0,11)
```




    10




```python
## c.rindex('y') un comment to see an error
```

### Split ( )
* The split() method then splits the string into substrings at each occurrence of the delimiter.
* The result is a list of the substrings.

* <b>Syntax</b> :split( sep=None, maxsplit=-1)
where,
* sep=none: It is used for separating words by using (' ')
* maxsplit: it means number of splits to do by defaul it takes "-1" as maxsplit



```python
d='I love Icecreams'
d.split(' ',maxsplit=1)
```




    ['I', 'love Icecreams']




```python
d.split(' ')
```




    ['I', 'love', 'Icecreams']



### String_rsplit ( )

* The rsplit() method is similar to the split() method for strings, but it splits the string from the right (end) to the left (beginning) based on a specified delimiter. This method is often used when you want to split a string into substrings, starting from the end of the string and moving towards the beginning.
 
* <b>Syntax </b>:d.rsplit(sep=None, maxsplit=-1)

* sep=none: It is used for separating words by using (' ')
* maxsplit: it means number of splits to do by defaul it takes "-1" as maxsplit



```python
e='No idea for taking an example'
e.rsplit(' ')
```




    ['No', 'idea', 'for', 'taking', 'an', 'example']




```python
e.rsplit(" ",maxsplit=3)
```




    ['No idea for', 'taking', 'an', 'example']



### String_partition ( )

*  the partition() method is used to split a string into three parts based on the occurrence of a specified separator or delimiter. It divides the string into three segments from left to right.

* <b>syntax</b> :  e.partition(sep, /)

* it will gives you only 3 partitons,even you give a number it will give 3 partitons only.
* The text before the first occurrence of the separator.
* The separator itself.
* The text after the first occurrence of the separator.


```python
f='I love india'
```


```python
f.partition(' ')
```




    ('I', ' ', 'love india')



if we want to remove that space we have to concatenate


```python
f.partition(' ')[0]+f.partition(' ')[2]
```




    'Ilove india'



### String_rpartition:

* The rpartition() method is used to split a string into three parts based on the occurrence of a specified separator or delimiter. It divides the string into three segments from right to left.

* <b>Syntax</b>: f.rpartition(sep, /)
* The text before the last occurrence of the separator.
* The separator itself.
* The text after the last occurrence of the separator.


```python
g='Innomatics research labs'
```


```python
g.rpartition(' ')
```




    ('Innomatics research', ' ', 'labs')




```python
g.rpartition(' ')[0]+g.partition(' ')[2]
```




    'Innomatics researchresearch labs'



### String_Split lines

* the splitlines() method is used to split a string into a list of lines based on line breaks. It's particularly useful for breaking down a multiline string into individual lines, which can be useful for processing or manipulating text data that contains line breaks, such as reading and working with text files or parsing structured data.
* <b>Syntax</b>:x.splitlines(keepends=False)
* keepends (optional): This is a Boolean parameter that, when set to True, retains the line-ending characters (such as newline or carriage return) at the end of each line. When set to False (the default), line-ending characters are removed.



```python
x=''''Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.\n 
a peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.\n
If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,\n
Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?'''

```


```python
x.splitlines()
```




    ["'Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.",
     ' ',
     'a peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked.',
     '',
     'If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers,',
     '',
     'Where’s the peck of pickled peppers Peter Piper picked?']
